# Lamp_stack_cloud_computing
Cloud computing class final project lampstack on docker containers with data base and server.
Docker is used to run the Flask server, MySQL database, and Ollama language model as separate containers and connect them on a shared internal network, similar in structure to a LAMP stack. This allows Flask to communicate with MySQL and Ollama using service names while keeping each service isolated. Docker Compose handled startup order and port mapping so the entire application can be started with docker compose up. We then built images for each Dockerfile and pushed them to Docker Hub. Rancher was used as a Kubernetes cluster management tool to deploy each container as a pod, monitor pod and container health, manage environment variables, and enforce network policies. Network policies controlled ingress and egress rules and only allowed TCP traffic to access the website as a security implementation.
